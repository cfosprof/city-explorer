City-Explorer 


## Overview
City Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore cities by searching for their names. Users can view the exact latitude and longitude of the location, as well as a map of the area. In the future, the app will also provide weather, movie, and restaurant information related to the city.

Architecture
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
- [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/) - Geocoding and maps API
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework for styling
This application is built using React for the frontend and, optionally, Node.js with Express.js for the backend (if you decide to create a separate server). It uses the following libraries and technologies:

React
Axios for making API requests
Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap for styling
LocationIQ API for geocoding
(Optional) Weather and Movie APIs for fetching weather and movie data
(Optional) Node.js and Express.js for server-side implementation
